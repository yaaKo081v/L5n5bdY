# Terms of Use

*Effective date: November 23, 2023*

We are Volentio JSD Limited ("us", "we", or "our") (trading as jsDelivr), a company registered in England and Wales under company registration number 14984373. Our registered office is at Suite 2a1, Northside House, Mount Pleasant, Barnet, England, EN4 9EB.

We operate the *jsdelivr.com* website (the "Website") and the CDN service ("jsDelivr CDN").
For the purposes of these Terms, (i) “Website” refers to *jsdelivr.com* and (ii) “jsDelivr CDN” refers to *cdn.jsdelivr.net*, our CDN service that is publicly available without a subscription (“the Services”).

Please read these Terms carefully, that together with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy), govern your use of the Website and jsDelivr CDN.
By using the Website or jsDelivr CDN, you confirm that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them.
If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Services.

## 1. Permitted Use and Third-Party Websites

jsDelivr CDN works as a Content Delivery Network for content already stored on npm, GitHub, and other third-party services. These platforms are not operated by us, and each of them has its own terms of use. Any content accessed via jsDelivr CDN must conform to the terms of the service from which it was retrieved. For example, when you use jsDelivr CDN to access GitHub, the content must conform to all GitHub's policies. Additionally, any content accessed via the jsDelivr CDN must conform to our own policies as described in this document.

As long as you do not violate our rules:
- using jsDelivr CDN is free for both personal and commercial use,
- there are no limits on bandwidth or number of requests,
- we will provide a reasonable level of support via GitHub issues and email for urgent and private matters.

## 2. Data Processing

Where we are processing personal data as a service provider or on behalf of enterprise or business users of jsDelivr CDN, we will process, transmit, and store personal data present in our jsDelivr CDN in accordance with the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.jsdelivr.com/documents/data-processing-agreement.pdf).

## 3. Proprietary Rights

Volentio JSD and our licensors, vendors, and agents retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and jsDelivr CDN. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under these Terms or by law, including all rights in relation to the look and feel of the Website and jsDelivr CDN. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the Website, jsDelivr CDN, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from Volentio JSD.

## 4. Hard Limits and Restrictions (jsDelivr CDN)

To maintain the performance and security of jsDelivr CDN, we have various limits and restrictions in place. These may include but are not limited to:
- maximum size of a single file,
- maximum number of files in a single package,
- maximum size of a single package,
- blocking of certain file extensions.

When requesting a resource that does not meet these limits, you will get an error response indicating the reason. The limits are set considerably higher than needed for most projects and may be further increased or removed for legitimate projects on request.

## 5. Soft Limits and Recommendations (jsDelivr CDN)

These limits are not automatically enforced by us, but you agree not to exceed them.

1. For projects using our GitHub proxy:
   - We recommend that the number of actively accessed files per repository does not exceed 10 000. If you have considerably more files, a custom proxy endpoint for your project may be a better fit.
   - The soft limit for the number of files per repository is 100 000.

These recommendations are not automatically enforced by our Service but may indicate whether a project falls within the Permitted or the Prohibited use when it is not immediately clear. We recommend that each project:
- has a meaningful name,
- has public documentation and an appropriate license that allows use by other people,
- in case of npm packages, links to a public source code repository,
- does not contain intentionally obfuscated code.

## 6. Prohibited Use (jsDelivr CDN)

The following behavior is prohibited in connection to your use or access of jsDelivr CDN:

1. Hosting or accessing content that:
   - contains malware or harmful code in any form,
   - violates proprietary rights of others,
   - is sexually explicit,
   - is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms.

2. Abusing the Service and its resources or using jsDelivr CDN as a general-purpose file or media hosting service. This includes, for example, in the case of jsDelivr CDN:
   - running an image hosting website and using jsDelivr CDN as a storage for all uploaded images,
   - hosting videos, file backups, or other files in large quantities.

   We recognize that there are legitimate projects that consist of a large number of files, and these are not considered abuse. For example: icons packs, apps, or games with a large number of assets.

3. Trying to bypass our limits or restrictions in any way. We will be happy to remove limits or provide custom solutions for legitimate projects.

## 7. Indemnity

You agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Website and jsDelivr CDN, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and our officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Website or jsDelivr CDN; (ii) your violation of these Terms or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.
