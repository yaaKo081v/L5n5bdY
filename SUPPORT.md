## Support
Support for security hardening changes to products is covered under the same guidance as DISA STIGs, found in [Broadcom KB 313142](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=94398)

Support for scripting and automation tools and examples is community-based and best effort.

If an issue is encountered please check the [open](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues in the issue tracker for the details of your issue. If you can't find it, or if you're not sure, open a new issue.

Always use guidance designated for the specific product and version you are running.

Always test changes in a dedicated test environment first.
