### Introduction

My interest in application security started when the company I was working for had a contract to build a new app with exclusive features protected behind a login screen and someone downloaded this app from the App Store, reverse engineered it and published a list of its features, including screenshots and text that our entire engineering team thought were protected by the login screen. I had to know _how_ they did that.

At this point in my career I had been working on iOS development for over 6 years, this helped me enter the application security field with an fairly robust understanding of the inner-workings of iOS apps, it was _"just"_ a matter of learning how to protect my applications. But to learn how to protect them, I had to learn how to break them first!

This course is my way of sharing with the community everything I've learned in the past few years of me doing this research full-time. It's intended to help new security enthusiasts explore the exciting world of reversing iOS apps and hopefully help iOS developers create better and more secure applications.

#### What WON'T be covered in this course

- How to jailbreak your device.
- iOS (the operating system) exploitation.
- Tweak development for jailbroken devices.
- Mobile backend API hacking.
- In-depth understanding of ARM assembly.

Just wanted to set the right expectations, this course is basically for everyone that's new to iOS application security and ARM binary reversing.

If you're still interested, join me in learning how to reverse iOS applications!

_Note: Don't worry if you don't have a jailbroken device, you'll only need it for [Module 2](Module-2/README.md). You can skip this module an come back to it once you get your hands on a jailbroken device._
